This repository contains codes regarding rainfall estimation through sound recordings, using machine learning and neural network algorithms 

The approach used in the jupyter notebook consists of analyzing the sound recordings through power spectrum density plots, selecting the best frequency range to be used as input in the models, associating the recordings with sychronized rain gauge measurements. It's worth mentioning that this is still a work in progress, research is still in its early stages, but preliminary results are rather exciting.
